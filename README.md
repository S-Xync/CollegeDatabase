# CollegeDatabase  
Java Project During my II year in Indian Institute Of Information Technology Guwahati  
The Code can be found on GitHub @ https://github.com/s-xync/CollegeDatabase

To start this project,  
First create a database and check all files for a string called dbString and change the string accordingly  
if  
username: xyzw  
password: abcd  
database name: fgh  
then  
String dbString="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/fgh?user=xyzw&password=abcd&useSSL=false";  
then First run DatabaseCreateTables.java  
then run DatabaseEntry.java  
the data will be taken from the files provided by me in data folder  
All the names are from my favourite TV Series :-)  
After running both java files,  
Just start tomcat server and done.  
TADA!!!!  

Have A Good Day! :-)
